# Awesome Security

A collection of awesome software, libraries, documents, books, resources and cool stuffs about security.

Inspired by [awesome-php](https://github.com/ziadoz/awesome-php), [awesome-python](https://github.com/vinta/awesome-python).

Thanks to all [contributors](https://github.com/sbilly/awesome-security/graphs/contributors), you're awesome and wouldn't be possible without you! The goal is to build a categorized community-driven collection of very well-known resources.

## Network

### Monitoring / Logging

* [justniffer](http://justniffer.sourceforge.net/) - Justniffer is a network protocol analyzer that captures network traffic and produces logs in a customized way, can emulate Apache web server log files, track response times and extract all "intercepted" files from the HTTP traffic.
* [httpry](http://dumpsterventures.com/jason/httpry/) - httpry is a specialized packet sniffer designed for displaying and logging HTTP traffic. It is not intended to perform analysis itself, but to capture, parse, and log the traffic for later analysis. It can be run in real-time displaying the traffic as it is parsed, or as a daemon process that logs to an output file. It is written to be as lightweight and flexible as possible, so that it can be easily adaptable to different applications.
* [ngrep](http://ngrep.sourceforge.net/) - ngrep strives to provide most of GNU grep's common features, applying them to the network layer. ngrep is a pcap-aware tool that will allow you to specify extended regular or hexadecimal expressions to match against data payloads of packets. It currently recognizes IPv4/6, TCP, UDP, ICMPv4/6, IGMP and Raw across Ethernet, PPP, SLIP, FDDI, Token Ring and null interfaces, and understands BPF filter logic in the same fashion as more common packet sniffing tools, such as tcpdump and snoop.
* [passivedns](https://github.com/gamelinux/passivedns) - A tool to collect DNS records passively to aid Incident handling, Network Security Monitoring (NSM) and general digital forensics. PassiveDNS sniffes traffic from an interface or reads a pcap-file and outputs
the DNS-server answers to a log file. PassiveDNS can cache/aggregate duplicate
DNS answers in-memory, limiting the amount of data in the logfile without
loosing the essens in the DNS answer.

### IDS / IPS / Host IDS / Host IPS
* [Security Onion](http://blog.securityonion.net/) - Security Onion is a Linux distro for intrusion detection, network security monitoring, and log management. It's based on Ubuntu and contains Snort, Suricata, Bro, OSSEC, Sguil, Squert, Snorby, ELSA, Xplico, NetworkMiner, and many other security tools. The easy-to-use Setup wizard allows you to build an army of distributed sensors for your enterprise in minutes!

### Full Packet Capture / Forensic

* [tcpflow](https://github.com/simsong/tcpflow) - tcpflow is a program that captures data transmitted as part of TCP connections (flows), and stores the data in a way that is convenient for protocol analysis and debugging. Each TCP flow is stored in its own file. Thus, the typical TCP flow will be stored in two files, one for each direction. tcpflow can also process stored 'tcpdump' packet flows.
* [Xplico](http://www.xplico.org/) - The goal of Xplico is extract from an internet traffic capture the applications data contained. For example, from a pcap file Xplico extracts each email (POP, IMAP, and SMTP protocols), all HTTP contents, each VoIP call (SIP), FTP, TFTP, and so on. Xplico isn’t a network protocol analyzer. Xplico is an open source Network Forensic Analysis Tool (NFAT).

## Endpoint

### Authentication

* [google-authenticator](https://code.google.com/p/google-authenticator/) - The Google Authenticator project includes implementations of one-time passcode generators for several mobile platforms, as well as a pluggable authentication module (PAM). One-time passcodes are generated using open standards developed by the Initiative for Open Authentication (OATH) (which is unrelated to OAuth). These implementations support the HMAC-Based One-time Password (HOTP) algorithm specified in RFC 4226 and the Time-based One-time Password (TOTP) algorithm specified in RFC 6238.

### Mobile / Android /iOS

* [android-security-awesome](https://github.com/ashishb/android-security-awesome) - A collection of android security related resources. A lot of work is happening in academia and industry on tools to perform dynamic analysis, static analysis and reverse engineering of android apps.
* [SecMobi Wiki](http://wiki.secmobi.com/) - A a collection of mobile security resources which including articles, blogs, books, groups, projects, tools and conferences. 


## Threat Intelligence

* [abuse.ch](https://www.abuse.ch/) - ZeuS Tracker / SpyEye Tracker / Palevo Tracker / Feodo Tracker tracks Command&Control servers (hosts) around the world and provides you a domain- and a IP-blocklist.
* [Emerging Threats - Open Source](http://emergingthreats.net/open-source/) - Emerging Threats began 10 years ago as an open source community for collecting Suricata and SNORT® rules, firewall rules, and other IDS rulesets. The open source community still plays an active role in Internet security, with more than 200,000 active users downloading the ruleset daily. The ETOpen Ruleset is open to any user or organization, as long as you follow some basic guidelines. Our ETOpen Ruleset is available for download any time.
* [PhishTank](http://www.phishtank.com/) - PhishTank is a collaborative clearing house for data and information about phishing on the Internet. Also, PhishTank provides an open API for developers and researchers to integrate anti-phishing data into their applications at no charge.
* [SBL / XBL / PBL / DBL / DROP / ROKSO](http://www.spamhaus.org/) - The Spamhaus Project is an international nonprofit organization whose mission is to track the Internet's spam operations and sources, to provide dependable realtime anti-spam protection for Internet networks, to work with Law Enforcement Agencies to identify and pursue spam and malware gangs worldwide, and to lobby governments for effective anti-spam legislation. 
* [Internet Storm Center](https://www.dshield.org/reports.html) - The ISC was created in 2001 following the successful detection, analysis, and widespread warning of the Li0n worm. Today, the ISC provides a free analysis and warning service to thousands of Internet users and organizations, and is actively working with Internet Service Providers to fight back against the most malicious attackers.
* [AutoShun](https://www.autoshun.org/) - AutoShun is a Snort plugin that allows you to send your Snort IDS logs to a centralized server that will correlate attacks from your sensor logs with other snort sensors, honeypots, and mail filters from around the world.
* [DNS-BH](http://www.malwaredomains.com/) - The DNS-BH project creates and maintains a listing of domains that are known to be used to propagate malware and spyware. This project creates the Bind and Windows zone files required to serve fake replies to localhost for any requests to these, thus preventing many spyware installs and reporting.
* [AlienVault Open Threat Exchange](http://www.alienvault.com/open-threat-exchange/dashboard) - AlienVault Open Threat Exchange (OTX), to help you secure your networks from data loss, service disruption and system compromise caused by malicious IP addresses.
* [Tor Bulk Exit List](https://collector.torproject.org/) - CollecTor, your friendly data-collecting service in the Tor network. CollecTor fetches data from various nodes and services in the public Tor network and makes it available to the world. If you're doing research on the Tor network, or if you're developing an application that uses Tor network data, this is your place to start.[TOR Node List](https://www.dan.me.uk/tornodes) /  [DNS Blacklists](https://www.dan.me.uk/dnsbl) / [Tor Node List](http://torstatus.blutmagie.de/)
* [leakedin.com](http://www.leakedin.com/) - The primary purpose of leakedin.com is to make visitors aware about the risks of loosing data. This blog just compiles samples of data lost or disclosed on sites like pastebin.com.
